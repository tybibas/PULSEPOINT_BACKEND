# RESEARCH METHODOLOGY DIRECTIVE: DEEP INTELLIGENCE
## "The Conflict-Based Audit"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Philosophy**: We do not summarize what management said. We expose what they *didn't* say, what the market *doesn't* believe, and where the "Say-Do Gap" creates risk.

## 1. What to Search (The "Conflict" Search)
The agent must proactively hunt for friction, not just consensus.

- **Multi-Quarter Narrative Evolution**:
    - **Protocol**: Fetch last 4 quarters of transcripts.
    - **Goal**: Identify "Narrative Drift" (e.g., Q1 "Growth" -> Q4 "Efficiency").
- **Peer Divergence (The "Comparative Truth")**:
    - **Protocol**: Fetch latest transcripts of at least 2 direct peers.
    - **Goal**: Find where Peer A is transparent about a headwind while Target B is opaque (The "Transparency Gap").
- **"Street Conflict" Keywords**:
    - Search Query Additions:
        - `[Ticker] "Analyst Note" "Skeptical"`
        - `[Ticker] "Dividend Sustainability"`
        - `[Ticker] "Governance Risk"`
        - `[Ticker] "Credibility Gap"`

## 2. What Data to Collect (The "Diagnostic Metrics")
Extract specific raw materials that fuel the Risk Audit.

- **Linguistic Friction**:
    - "Defensive Markers": Quotes where management uses hedging language (e.g., "strategic optionality", "it's too early to call", "as we previously stated").
- **Valuation vs. Narrative**:
    - **Analyst Focus**: Top 3 drivers of stock price (e.g., FCF, Margins).
    - **Management Focus**: Top 3 KPIs highlighted in script (e.g., Store Closures).
    - **The Gap**: Does management talk about things that don't drive valuation?
- **Institutional Signals**:
    - "Register Drift": Major funds reducing positions.
    - "Secret Modeling": Analysts modeling outcomes management hasn't admitted.

## 3. High-Fidelity Sources
Prioritize domains with "Unvarnished Friction".

| Source | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Seeking Alpha / Motley Fool** | Deep-archive transcripts & "Unscripted" Q&A friction. |
| **Bloomberg / FT / Reuters** | "Street Consensus" & "Market Narrative" context. |
| **SEC EDGAR (10-K/10-Q)** | "Risk Factors" buried in filings vs. glossed over in calls. |
| **QuantiFire Testimonials** | "Value Hooks" reference (e.g., "Authentic Feedback", "Boardroom Power"). |

## 4. Synthesis Logic (The "Validation" Lens)
Process all data through the **Broker-Filter Audit**.

1.  **Identify the "Polite" Fact**:
    - *Input*: "Management announced 1,200 store closures."
2.  **Apply "Street Friction" Overlay**:
    - *Context*: "Analysts worry this shrinks the revenue base needed for the dividend."
3.  **Create "Direct Validation Hypothesis"**:
    - *Output*: "Do top holders view these closures as 'rationalization' or a 'defensive retreat' that threatens dividend sustainability?"
4.  **Assign "Governance Discount"**:
    - *Logic*: If Target is less transparent than Peer -> "Narrative Cession" -> Activist Risk.

## 5. Final Output Standard
Every finding must be framed as an **Unconfirmed Risk** that only QuantiFire's **Feedback Intelligence** can resolve.
- **Bad**: "Analysts are worried about the dividend."
- **Good**: "The opacity around dividend coverage has created a 'Governance Discount' that only direct investor feedback can resolve."
