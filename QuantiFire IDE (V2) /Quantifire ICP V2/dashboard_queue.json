We fix that by analyzing the raw, unvarnished perception of your register.\n\nI have a Strategic Diagnostic prepared for Zalando SE that identifies specific friction points your current reporting may be missing.\n\nDo you want to see the audit before your next Board pack goes out?\n\nBest,\nYour Name\nQuantiFire"
