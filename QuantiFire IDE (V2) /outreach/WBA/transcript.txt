Operator:
Good morning. My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Walgreens Boots Alliance Fourth Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call.

Tim Wentworth - CEO:
Thank you. Fiscal 2025 was a year of pivotal transition for WBA. While we made significant progress in our strategic review, the consumer environment remains **challenging**. We are accelerating our **U.S. retail footprint optimization program**, with plans to close approximately 1,200 underperforming stores over the next three years, typically at lease expiration.

Revenue for the quarter increased 1.2% to $36 billion, reflecting growth in our U.S. Healthcare segment, offset by **continued softness in front-of-store retail sales**. The consumer is under pressure, and we are seeing a shift towards value-seeking behavior that has impacted our margin profile.

Manmohan Mahajan - CFO:
Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.32, down 40% on a constant currency basis. This decline was primarily driven by **weaker U.S. retail performance** and a lower tax benefit compared to the prior year. We are **lowering our fiscal 2026 guidance** to reflect these persistent macro headwinds. We now expect Adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.60.

Q&A Session:

Lisa Gill - JPMorgan:
Tim, can you provide more color on the "footprint optimization"? Is 1,200 stores the ceiling, and how confident are you in the "value" pivot given the margin compression?

Tim Wentworth:
Lisa, the 1,200 figure is a **firm target** based on current profitability thresholds. We believe this right-sizing is critical. Regarding value, we *must* be relevant. It's not a choice. Yes, it pressures margins near-term, but it protects traffic.

George Hill - Deutsche Bank:
The guidance cut is significant. What are you assuming for the U.S. consumer in 2026?

Manmohan Mahajan:
George, we are assuming the current environment **persists**. We differ from some peers who see a rebound; we prefer to remain **prudent** and cautious. We are not baking in a recovery in discretionary stickiness.

Charles Rhyee - TD Cowen:
On the U.S. Healthcare segment -- VillageMD breakeven seems delayed again. Is there a timeline you can commit to?

Tim Wentworth:
We are reviewing all options. The timeline is... fluid. We are committed to the asset but **cannot carry indefinite losses**.
