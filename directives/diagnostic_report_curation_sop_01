SOP-01: Governance Blindspot Audit (The Trojan Horse)
Objective: To minimize the "Narrative Gap" between Management's Scripted Story and the Market's Unvarnished Reality. This report is a fiduciary risk diagnostic, not a marketing summary.
Philosophy: Be Clinical, Urgent, and Fiduciary.
- BAN: Passive suggestions (e.g., "Consider enhancing culture").
- ENFORCE: Risk warnings (e.g., "The Broker Filter is masking a critical retention risk").
- CORE THESIS: The "Broker Filter" sanitizes feedback. We must bypass it.

Phase 1: The Diagnosis (The Gap)
Input: Management's "Prepared Remarks" vs. Market's "Q&A Sentiment".
Output: "Management projects confidence in X, but the Net Confidence Score (NCS) drops by Y% when pressed."
Action: Calculate the Sentiment Velocity drop. If >15% drop, flag as "Credibility Gap."

Phase 2: The Quantification (The Cost)
Input: Valuation Gap (Intrinsic vs. Market Price).
Output: "This credibility gap is currently pricing the stock at a discount, trapping $[Value] in unrealized shareholder value."
Action: Use FMP API/OpenAI to "redrive" valuation based on management's own assumptions. Dollarize the gap.

Phase 3: The Prescription (The Trojan Horse)
Action: Position "ongoing monitoring" as the ONLY way to bypass the Broker Filter.
Output: "To close this valuation gap, the CFO must adopt unfiltered buy-side monitoring to detect these sentiment divergences before earnings calls."

Phase 4: Synthesis & Tone
- Insight Rule: Every insight MUST cite the NCS or Valuation Gap.
- Format: "Clinical/Urgent". Use Action Titles that sound like warnings (e.g., "Governance mechanisms are failing to capture internal dissent").
