SOP-02: Strategic Research Source Protocols (High-Fidelity Data Stack)
Objective: To define the specific data sources and extraction methodologies required to build the "Strategic Diagnostic." The goal is to bypass generic web scraping and access "Institutional-Grade" intelligence that reveals the "Shadow Narrative."
Protocol: Do not rely on Google News or basic press releases. You must prioritize the following three data layers.
Layer 1: The "Ground Truth" Stack (Qualitative Reality)
Use these sources to expose the "Broker Filter" and hear what the market is actually saying.
1. Expert Networks (Tegus / AlphaSense Stream / Third Bridge)
Purpose: To access "unfiltered" due diligence interviews between investors and former employees, customers, or competitors .
Search Protocol:
Query: [Ticker] + "Former Employee" OR "Competitor"
Extraction Target: Look for "friction points" (e.g., "culture issues," "sales cycle paralysis," "pricing pressure") that contradict management's public claims .
Diagnostic Action: Compare these quotes against the Sell-Side research headlines. If they diverge, the "Sanitization Score" is high.
2. Consensus Granularity (Visible Alpha)
Purpose: To see the actual working models of sell-side analysts, not just their published price targets .
Search Protocol:
Drill-Down: Do not look at "Total Revenue." Look at specific operational drivers (e.g., "iPhone Units Sold," "Subscription Churn," "Widget Pricing").
Extraction Target: Identify line items where the "Consensus Model" is flat or declining while Management Guidance is rising.
Diagnostic Action: This divergence identifies exactly where the "Broker Filter" is failing to convey the strategy .
Layer 2: The "Valuation" Stack (Quantitative Reality)
Use these sources to dollarize the "Narrative Gap."
1. Driver-Based Modeling (Canalyst)
Purpose: To "redrive" the company's valuation by manipulating underlying assumptions .
Methodology (The "What-If" Test):
Action: Take the Canalyst model and input Management's internal budget assumptions (e.g., "10% Growth").
Compare: Contrast the resulting implied share price against the current market trading price.
Diagnostic Action: If the implied price is higher than the trading price, calculate the difference. Label this the "Cost of Misunderstanding" (e.g., "$400M Market Cap Opportunity") .
2. Peer Benchmarking (S&P Capital IQ)
Purpose: To contextualize the gap against competitors.
Methodology (Data Arbitrage):
Action: Compare the target's "Detailed Estimates" against peer averages.
Extraction Target: Look for "Revision Trends." If peers are seeing upward revisions while the target is seeing downward revisions despite positive news, credibility is eroding.
Layer 3: The "Sentiment & Risk" Stack (The Vibe)
Use these sources to detect "Spin" and "Vulnerability."
1. Audio Biomarkers (Aiera / Quartr)
Purpose: To analyze how management speaks, not just what they say.
Methodology (The Divergence Trap):
Action: Compare the NLP sentiment score of "Prepared Remarks" (Scripted) vs. "Q&A" (Unscripted).
Advanced Extraction: Use Aiera to detect "Incongruence"—where positive words are spoken with "uncertainty" (shaky pitch, hesitation) .
Diagnostic Action: If Unscripted Sentiment is significantly lower than Scripted, flag as a "Short Seller Trigger" .
2. Activism Screens (FactSet SharkRepellent / Diligent)
Purpose: To determine if the company is "structurally vulnerable" to a hostile takeover.
Search Protocol:
Check Defenses: Does the company have a "Staggered Board" or "Poison Pill"?.
Check History: Has an activist targeted a peer with a similar financial profile (e.g., High Cash, Low Growth)? .
Diagnostic Action: If Vulnerability is High + Valuation is Low, trigger the "Activism Alarm" .
Summary of Execution Logic
Start with Visible Alpha to find the math error.
Verify with Tegus to find the human reason.
Dollarize with Canalyst to show the cost.
Confirm Risk with Aiera and SharkRepellent to show the urgency.
