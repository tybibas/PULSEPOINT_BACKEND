Starting with the current price of MSFT at $150, the current P/E ratio is 25. If the market fully credits the 10% growth assumption, the earnings are expected to grow by 10%. With this growth rate, the new earnings can be estimated to reflect this change, and the current P/E ratio is maintained to calculate the future price. So, the adjusted price is calculated as $150 * 1.10, resulting in an implied price of $165. The methodology used involves applying the growth rate directly to the current price, assuming the P/E ratio remains constant.",
