## Outreach Strategy

3. **Value:** Connect murals to their business outcome (leasing, tenant experience, brand)
4. **Ask:** Low-commitment next step (mood board, site visit, portfolio share)

### Sample Hook Templates

**For New Development:**
> "Saw the groundbreaking announcement for [PROJECT NAME] – exciting to see more Class A life science space coming to [AREA]. We've helped similar developments create lobby experiences that become the building's signature moment. Would a quick mood board for the common areas be useful at this stage?"

**For Renovation/Rebrand:**
> "Read about the repositioning of [PROPERTY NAME] – smart timing with the market shift. Murals are one of the highest-impact, lowest-cost ways to signal 'new era' to prospective tenants. Happy to share some before/after examples from similar projects."

**For Architecture Firms:**
> "Your work on [PROJECT NAME] caught my attention – beautiful integration of indoor/outdoor space. We partner with firms like yours to specify custom murals and environmental graphics. If it's ever useful to have a go-to for hand-painted elements, I'd love to introduce our work."
