## Outreach Strategy

### Recommended Approach
1. **Do NOT** lead with Peter Fritz - he's too senior and busy
2. **Do** target Brandon Maddox or Eric Hotovy first - they're closer to project execution
3. **Reference** specific project context (Bioterra, SOVA, etc.)
4. **Position** murals as enhancing tenant experience and leasing velocity

### Draft Hook (for Brandon Maddox)

```
Subject: Making SOVA the Campus Everyone Wants to Visit

Hi Brandon,

Saw that Centerpark Labs just won Life Science Campus of the Year – congrats to the whole team. Creating award-winning spaces is no small feat.

As you continue shaping projects like SOVA and Bioterra, I wanted to share how hand-painted murals are helping similar campuses become destinations, not just buildings. We've been working with commercial developers across San Diego to create lobby experiences that tenants actually take photos in front of.

I have some quick concepts for how environmental art could elevate your tenant amenity spaces. Would it be useful to see a mood board tailored to SOVA's vibe?

Cheers,

### Draft Hook (for Eric Hotovy - Design Focus)

```
Subject: Art That Meets Your Construction Timeline

Hi Eric,

As Project Executive overseeing design and construction for Longfellow's San Diego properties, you probably get a lot of pitches for finish work. Here's why we're different:

We do hand-painted murals and environmental graphics for commercial spaces – with the reliability you need. Think original art that becomes the building's signature moment, installed on your schedule, not an artist's schedule.

With projects like Bioterra coming up, I'd love to share some examples of how we've helped similar developments create spaces tenants remember.

Worth a quick call?
