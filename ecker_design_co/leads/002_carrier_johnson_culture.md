## Outreach Strategy

### Recommended Approach
1. **Lead with Jackie Angel** - Director of Operations, handles vendor relationships
2. **Position as partner, not vendor** - architects want creative collaborators
3. **Reference specific project types** they've done that benefit from murals
4. **Offer portfolio tailored** to commercial/education work

### Draft Hook (for Jackie Angel)

```
Subject: A Go-To Partner for Custom Environmental Art

Hi Jackie,

Your firm's work on the UCSD Structural Engineering Building caught my attention – the way you integrate technical rigor with thoughtful design is impressive.

I run Ecker Design Co., and we do hand-painted murals and environmental graphics for commercial and educational spaces. Architects like you often need a reliable creative partner for art specifications that clients will remember.

Rather than sourcing existing art, we create original, site-specific pieces – and we deliver on schedule, which I know matters as much as the design.

Would it be useful to have a go-to for hand-crafted environmental art? I'd love to share our portfolio and discuss how we could support your upcoming projects.

Cheers,
Mike Ecker
Ecker Design Co.

### Draft Hook (for Marin Gertler - CDO)

```
Subject: Custom Murals That Elevate Your Design Vision

Hi Marin,

As Chief Design Officer at Carrier Johnson, you set the creative bar for projects that shape San Diego's built environment.

We create hand-painted murals and custom environmental graphics for commercial and institutional spaces. Unlike sign shops or art consultants sourcing existing work, we design and execute original pieces tailored to each project's architecture and brand story.

I'd love to show you some examples of how we've helped architects translate design intent into memorable moments within their buildings. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Mike Ecker
Ecker Design Co.
