### Draft Hook (for Christopher Tipre)

```
Subject: Art That Accelerates Leasing

Hi Christopher,

As Principal leading life science development in San Diego, you're navigating a market where tenant experience matters as much as lab specs.

We create hand-painted murals and environmental graphics for commercial spaces – the kind of finishes that make prospective tenants stop, take photos, and remember your building over the competition.

With the Class A life science market as competitive as it is, I've seen developers use lobby murals as a low-cost, high-impact way to differentiate. One becomes the building's signature moment.

Worth a quick call to share some examples from similar developments?

Best,
Mike Ecker

### Alternative Hook (Project-Specific)

```
Subject: Making Your Next Life Science Campus the Destination

Hi Christopher,

Congrats on TCC's continued growth in San Diego's life science market. The region's biotech demand makes this an exciting time to be developing here.

I specialize in hand-painted murals and environmental graphics for commercial campuses. Think lobby experiences that become the photo op, the conversation starter, the thing tenants remember about your building.

As you shape upcoming projects in the pipeline, would it be useful to see how murals could enhance your amenity spaces? Happy to share a quick mood board tailored to your project style.

Cheers,
Mike Ecker
Ecker Design Co.
