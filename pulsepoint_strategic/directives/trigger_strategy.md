# Trigger Strategy: PulsePoint Strategic

## 1. Hiring for Sales/SDR
- **Search Logic:** Companies posting jobs for "Sales Development Representative", "BDR", "Account Executive" (junior), or "Business Development Manager".
- **Rationale:** They are about to spend ~$60k/year + management time.
- **Pitch Angle:** Identify companies hiring sales roles and offer a system that does the job for 1/10th the cost and "never sleeps".

## 2. Recent Big Project / Case Study (Service Firms)
- **Search Logic:** News or posts about "Completed HQ build", "Major Rebrand", "New Client Win", "Case Study released".
- **Rationale:** Proof of competence and high-ticket delivery. They have momentum but might need more of that specific type of work.
- **Pitch Angle:** "Congrats on [Project]. I built a list of similar companies who need exactly that."

## 3. New VP of Sales / Head of Sales (Tech/SaaS)
- **Search Logic:** "New VP of Sales" appointments, LinkedIn updates for "Head of Sales" (past 90 days).
- **Rationale:** New leaders want to make their mark and buy tools to improve efficiency.
- **Pitch Angle:** Optimize their new tenure with better infrastructure.

## 4. Recent Funding (Seed / Series A)
- **Search Logic:** Companies that announced Seed or Series A funding in the last 3-6 months.
- **Rationale:** Pressure to grow, cash in hand, risk of burning it on headcount inefficiently.
- **Pitch Angle:** "Don't burn it all on headcount. Build a signal-based engine first."
