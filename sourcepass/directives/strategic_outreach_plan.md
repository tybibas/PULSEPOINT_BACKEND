# SOURCEPASS Strategic Outreach Research Plan

> **Objective:** Identify highest-converting target industries/sectors for Sourcepass outreach based on demonstrated success, closability, and volume potential.

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing all **18 Sourcepass success stories** in depth, I've identified the optimal outreach strategy. The findings reveal that **Healthcare (HIPAA-regulated)** is overwhelmingly the highest-value target—but the path to closing these deals requires specific trigger events and messaging.

**Bottom Line:** Focus 60% of effort on Healthcare/Medical, 25% on Non-Profit/Housing, and 15% on Commercial/Real Estate.

## Industry Analysis (Ranked by Conversion Potential)

### 🥇 TIER 1: Healthcare & Medical Services
**Case Studies:** 6 (33% of all success stories)
**Conversion Potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Client | Problem | Solution | Outcome |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| Medical Society of Delaware | EMR software glitches, HIPAA gaps | Advanced security, MFA, SIEM | Zero downtime for critical systems |
| Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition | Compliance gaps, ransomware risk | SOC 2/HIPAA alignment | Full compliance achieved |
| Health Care Advocates Intl (HCAI) | SOC 2 audit preparation | Compliance partner + audit prep | "Most professional audit ever" |
| Gold Coast Fertility | Patient data security | Co-managed to fully managed | 100% accreditation success |
| GI Consultants | IT leadership vacuum (director left) | 48-hour emergency onboarding | Operations stabilized |
| Anonymous Healthcare Practice | Website/e-commerce for patient products | Custom web development | Revenue-generating platform |

**Why Healthcare Wins:**
1. **Highest demonstrable ROI:** Sourcepass enables compliance certifications (HIPAA, SOC 2) that are required for operations. Without compliance = no business.
2. **Tangible, quotable outcomes:** "Most professional and thorough audit" is a killer testimonial.
3. **Clear decision-makers:** CIO, CISO, Compliance Officer, CEO (in smaller practices)
4. **Strong trigger events:** Ransomware attacks, HIPAA audits, IT leadership turnover, breach notifications

**Recommended Outreach Triggers:**
- IT Director/CIO resignation or new hire
- Recent HIPAA audit announcement
- Peer organization data breach (fear-based urgency)
- Annual compliance deadline approaching

### 🥈 TIER 2: Non-Profit, Housing & Community Development
**Case Studies:** 3 (17% of all success stories)
**Conversion Potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Client | Problem | Solution | Outcome |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| SafePassage | Budget constraints, aging hardware | Large-scale HP ProBook refresh | Enterprise-grade tools on nonprofit budget |
| Hearthway Housing | Workspace disruption during renovation | Temporary site networking | Zero downtime during transition |
| Way Finders | No high-availability for remote staff | High-availability network architecture | Social workers can serve clients without friction |

**Why Non-Profit Works:**
1. **Budget-conscious messaging resonates:** These orgs need to maximize every dollar.
2. **Lower competition:** Enterprise MSPs don't target nonprofits—Sourcepass has limited competition here.
3. **Gatekeepers are approachable:** Executive Directors and Operations Directors are accessible.
4. **"Mission-aligned" positioning:** Sourcepass can frame work as community impact.

**Recommended Outreach Triggers:**
- Grant funding received for technology upgrades
- Office move or renovation announcement
- Leadership transition (new ED often modernizes)
- Volunteer/staff growth requiring IT scaling

### 🥉 TIER 3: Real Estate & Property Management
**Case Studies:** 3 (17% of all success stories)
**Conversion Potential:** ⭐⭐⭐

| Client | Problem | Solution | Outcome |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| Netter Real Estate | Risk during high-stakes transaction windows | Proactive hardware procurement | Zero downtime during peak cycles |
| TSCG (The Shopping Center Group) | Aging Windows 10 fleet, multi-office connectivity | 24/7 helpdesk, hardware refresh | Seamless standardization |
| Hearthway (overlap) | High-density wireless needs | Infrastructure build-out | 100% wireless coverage |

**Why Real Estate is Mid-Tier:**
1. **Transactional urgency creates opportunities:** Real estate firms CANNOT afford downtime during deal closings.
2. **Hardware refresh is a clear entry point:** Windows 10 end-of-life is forcing upgrades.
3. **BUT: Decision-making is distributed:** Partners/brokers operate independently, making firm-wide deals harder.

**Recommended Outreach Triggers:**
- Windows 10 end-of-life (October 2025)
- New office opening or expansion
- M&A activity (consolidating firms)
- Peak season approaching (closings ramp up)

---

### 🎯 TIER 4: Core Commercial (Sports, Manufacturing, Logistics, Insurance)
**Case Studies:** 5 (28% of all success stories)
**Conversion Potential:** ⭐⭐⭐

| Client | Sector | Problem | Solution | Outcome |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| Philadelphia 76ers | Sports/Entertainment | Disparate data environments | Managed backup (Acronis) | 50% faster ticket resolution |
| Centrix | Manufacturing/Distribution | Seasonal staffing spikes | Staff Augmentation | Onsite tech during peaks |
| Universal Traffic Service | Logistics | ERP/Dynamics licensing issues | Sourcepass Infinity | Reduced cost with annual enhancements |
| Finck & Perras Insurance | Professional Services | HITRUST certification maintenance | Cyber Risk Advisory | Certification maintained |
| Axion | Contact Centers | Staffing model optimization | Staff Aug + co-managed | Scalable support |

**Why Commercial is Mixed:**
1. **Exceptional outcomes where they land:** 50% improvement metrics are impressive.
2. **BUT: These are enterprise-adjacent accounts:** Longer sales cycles, RFP processes.
3. **Staff Augmentation is a niche offering:** Not every prospect needs it.
4. **Best fit:** Mid-market companies ($20M-$200M revenue) with complex ERP/compliance needs.

**Recommended Outreach Triggers:**
- HITRUST/SOC 2 certification deadline
- ERP migration or Dynamics licensing changes
- M&A requiring IT integration
- Peak season staffing needs

---

### 📌 TIER 5: Government & Education (Situational)
**Case Studies:** 2 (11% of all success stories)
**Conversion Potential:** ⭐⭐

| Client | Problem | Solution | Outcome |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| Suffolk County Town (Anonymous) | Seasonal population spikes, tourism IT needs | SDWAN, Meraki deployment | 100% wireless coverage |
| Long Island School District (Anonymous) | Ransomware threat, cyber liability insurance | Rapid MFA rollout | Insurance compliance met |

**Why Gov/Edu is Lowest Priority:**
1. **Procurement is brutal:** RFP processes, multi-year cycles, lowest-bidder culture.
2. **BUT: When they close, they stick:** Government contracts are stable and renewable.
3. **Education has concentrated decision-making:** Superintendent or IT Director controls budget.

**Recommended Outreach Triggers:**
- Cyber liability insurance audit/renewal
- Ransomware attack at peer district
- Bond funding for technology modernization
- New IT Director appointed
